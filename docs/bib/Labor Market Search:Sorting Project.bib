Workers respond to mismatch by intensive search, and sorting may result from complementarities in the match-level production function. The model is estimated on Danishmatched employer\textendash employee data. Firms are ranked through revealed preference by the fraction of hires that is poached from other firms: the poaching rank. Identification is obtained by firm rank conditional mobility and wage patterns. Wage variation is decomposed into four sources: sorting (40\%), worker heterogeneity (32\%), firm heterogeneity (18\%), and frictional competition (10\%). A social planner can improve output net of search cost by 1.5\% relative to the decentralized solution.},

The analysis highlights the interaction between a productive motive, driven by the surplus attainable in a match, and a strategic motive, driven by reciprocity of interest of potential matches. We find that the interaction between these two motives differs with preferences\textemdash vertical versus horizontal\textemdash and that this interaction implies that preferences recovered using our model can look markedly different from those recovered using a model where the degree of randomness is not endogenous. We illustrate these results using data on the U.S. marriage market and show that the model can rationalize the finding of aspirational dating.},

A model of matching friction explains the qualitative responses of the labor market to adverse shocks, but requires implausibly large shocks to account for the magnitude of observed fluctuations. The incorporation of wage stickiness vastly increases the sensitivity of the model to driving forces. I develop a new model of the way that wage stickiness affects unemployment. The stickiness arises in an economic equilibrium and satisfies the condition that no worker-employer pair has an unexploited opportunity for mutual improvement. Sticky wages neither interfere with the efficient formation of employment matches nor cause inefficient job loss. Thus the model provides an answer to the fundamental criticism previously directed at sticky-wage models of fluctuations.},

The model improves on previous work in two respects: it covers optimal sequences of location decisions (rather than a single once-for-all choice) and it allows for many alternative location choices. The model is estimated using panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on white males with a high-school education. Our main conclusion is that interstate migration decisions are influenced to a substantial extent by income prospects. The results suggest that the link between income and migration decisions is driven both by geographic differences in mean wages and by a tendency to move in search of a better locational match when the income realization in the current location is unfavorable.},

  abstract = {We set up a search model with on-the-job search that spans random and competitive search as well as intermediate cases with partially directed search. Firms are heterogeneous in terms of productivity, and firms with different productivities are in different submarkets, with all firms in the same submarket being identical. Workers are identical, still a worker's optimal search behavior, that is, the optimal submarket for her to visit, depends on the productivity of the current employer. The higher is the productivity of the current employer, the higher is the productivity of the firm it is optimal for the worker to target her search at. We use a discrete choice framework to model the workers' choice of submarkets, with a single noise parameter \textmu{} governing the degree to which search is directed. As \textmu{} goes to zero, search becomes fully directed, while it becomes random as \textmu{} goes to infinity. We derive the equilibrium of the model, and simulate the equilibrium allocation. We also show how the parameter \textmu{} can be identified using a maximum likelihood approach where submarkets are identified via the Bagger and Lentz (2016) poaching rank, or in a classification step as in Lentz, Piyapromdee and Robin (2017). Alternatively, we use a simulated method of moments approach. We will identify \textmu{} on Danish and/or Norwegian matched employer-employee data.},

The theory of rational inattention assumes that agents cannot process all available information, but they can choose which exact pieces of information to attend to. Several important results in economics have been built around imperfect information. Nowadays, many more forms of information than ever before are available due to new technologies, and yet we are able to digest little of it. Which form of imperfect information we possess and act upon is thus largely determined by which information we choose to pay attention to. These choices are driven by current economic conditions and imply behavior that features numerous empirically supported departures from standard models. Combining these insights about human limitations with the optimizing approach of neoclassical economics yields a new, generally applicable model. (JEL D83, D91, E71)},
