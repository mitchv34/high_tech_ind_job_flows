<!-- TODO: Wtite a one page introduction -->

*Notes*:

- I adopt the framework from [@liseMacrodynamicsSortingWorkers2017].
- Introducing a fixed amount of locations and population distribution of workers should be an equilibrium outcome.
- Workers can "partially" direct their search to each location.
  - In practice workers randomize over locations paying a cost.
  - Cost of random search is zero.
  - Cost increases unboundedly as the worker directs their search to a particular location.
- Productivity depends on the quality of match and aggregate state as in the original paper. I want to introduce a third component which is location productivity. 
  - I intend to use idea exchange as the driver of location productivity.
  - I plan to draw on a framework similar to [@davisSpatialKnowledgeEconomy2019] to model the value added to production by idea exchange.
