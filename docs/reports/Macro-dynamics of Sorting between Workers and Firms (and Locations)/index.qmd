title: Introduction
---
*Notes*:

- I adopt the framework from [@liseMacrodynamicsSortingWorkers2017].
- Introducing a fixed amount of locations and population distribution of workers should be an equilibrium outcome.
- Workers can "partially" direct their search to each location.
  - In practice workers randomize over locations paying a cost.
  - Cost of random search is zero.
  - Cost increases unboundedly as the worker directs their search to a particular location.
- Productivity depends on the quality of match and aggregate state as in the original paper. I want to introduce a third component which is location productivity. 
  - I intend to use idea exchange as the driver of location productivity.
  - I plan to draw on a framework similar to [@davisSpatialKnowledgeEconomy2019] to model the value added to production by idea exchange.

**TODO**:

- [ ] Read [@simsImplicationsRationalInattention2003]
- [ ] Read [@matejkaRationalInattentionDiscrete2015]
- [ ] Check that the unemployment value function is a contraction.
- [ ] Think about distribution of firms across and within locations.
- [ ] Solve a modified version of the model where there is no aggregate state.
- [ ] Solve a two location version of the model to gain intuition.
- [ ] Think if I could include the cost of moving to a different location in the cost of the mixed strategy.
- [ ] For now the cost of posting only depends on the number of vacancies, should I introduce a location component? I think It will be important to have only high productive firms posting a lot of vacancies in high productivity locations.
