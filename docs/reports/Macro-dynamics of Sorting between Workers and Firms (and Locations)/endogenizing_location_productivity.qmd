# Edogenizing Location Productivity and Cost of Living

This section focus on how the distribution of workers (skils) affect both the productivity of matches $f(x,y,j,z)$ and the instant utility of workers $b(x,j,z)$.

## Location Productivity

I borrow from [@davisSpatialKnowledgeEconomy2019] in assuming that the productivity of workers in a location $j$ is a result of idea exchange process within each location.

-   Assume that a type $x$ worker in location $j$ has a $B(x, \overline{X}^j)$ where $\overline{X}^j$ is the value of idea exchange in location $j$. Thus: $$f(x,y,j,z) = f\left(B(x, \overline{X}^j), y, z\right)$$
-   Assume that the value of idea exchange in location $j$ is a function of the distribution of skills in location $j$: $\overline{X}^j = \overline{X}\left(\left\{\ell^j(x)\right\}\right)$

It's natural to make the following assumptions on $B(x, \overline{X}^j)$ and $\overline{X}^j$:

-   **Assumption 1**: $B(x, \overline{X}^j)$ should be increasing in $x$ and $\overline{X}^j$ and in the absence of idea exchange, worker productivity is just their type: $B(x, 0) = x$.
-   **Assumption 2**: Worker type $x$ and idea exchange environment are complements i.e. $B(x, \overline{X}^j)$ supermodular in ($x$ , $\overline{X}^j$).
-   **Assumption 3**: [**\[TO DO\]**]{style="color:red"} Idea exchange environment is "increasing" in the distribution of skills in location $j$. Probable need First Order Stocastic Dominance (FOSD) to define "increasing" in this context.

I will focus on the following functional forms for $B(x, \overline{X}^j)$ and $\overline{X}^j$:

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
    B(x, \overline{X}^j) = x(1 + A \overline{X}^j x)
\end{equation}
```
where $A$ is a parameter that captures the scope of gains from idea exchange.

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
    \overline{X}\left(\left\{\ell^j(x)\right\}\right) = \left(1 - e^{-\nu \int \ell^j(x) dx}\right)\hat{x}^j =\left(1 - e^{-\nu \mu^j} \right)\hat{x}^j
\end{equation}
```
The probability of encountering someone during each moment of time seeking is given by $1 - \exp(-Î½ \mu^j)$, note that as the number of potential exchange partners ($\mu^j$) increases, the probability of encountering someone also increases, which makes intuitive sense.

The average ability of the individuals you encounter in these exchanges is denoted as $\hat{x}^j$. This is a weighted average of the abilities of the people you meet $$\hat{x}^j = \frac{1}{\mu^j}\int{x\ell^j(x)dx}=\frac{\mathbb{E}^j[x]}{\mu^j}$$ where $\mathbb{E}^j[x]$ is the average ability of workers in location $j$.
