# Model Summary


## Model Setup

### Demographics

-   There is a discrete and finite set of locations $\mathcal{J}=\{1,\dots,|\mathcal{J}|\}$ locations indexed by $j\in\mathcal{J}$.
-   Continuum of workers indexed by their ability $x\in \mathcal{X}$.
    -   The total measure is normalized to $1$.
    -   Exogenous distribution $\ell(x)$
    -   Endogenous distribution in each location $\ell^{j}(x)$
    -   Denote $\zeta_j$ the total population in location $j$.
-   Continuum of firms indexed by technology $y\in \mathcal{Y}$.
    -   Total measure is normalized to $1$.
    -   Uniformly distributed.

### Technology
-   There is exogenous cost of posting $v$ job opportunities in location $j$ is $$c_{j}(v)\geq0$$ assume it is increasing, convex, and independent of the firm type $y$ (but *potentially* dependent on location).
-   Workers and firms discount the future at the rate $\beta$.
-   Workers can move across locations:
    -   Workers choose a mixed strategy to search: $$
        \phi^j_i(x) = \{\phi^j_i(x, j')\}_{j'\in \mathcal{J}}
        $$ where $\phi^j_i(x, j')$ is the probability that a type $x$ worker from location $j$ search in location $j'$ and $i\in \{u,s\}$ refers to the employment status of the worker.
    -   Each strategy has an asociated cost $c_s(\phi_i^j(x))$:
    $$c_s(\phi^j_i(x)) = c \sum_{j'\in \mathcal{J}}\phi^j_i(x, j')\log{(J\phi^i_j(x, j'))}$$
    -   When a worker move they must pay a cost $F^{j \to j'}\geq 0$ (with $F^{j\to j} = 0$).

-   Unemployed workers instant utility in each location is $b(x,j)$.
-   Firms have access to a production technology, defined at the match level and depending on the location  $f(x, y, j)$.

Both unemployed and employed workers search, denote $s$ the search intensity of an employed worker and $1$ is the (normalized) search intensity of an unemployed worker. The total search intensity in location $j$ is 
$$L^j = \sum_{j'\in\mathcal{J}}\left[\int \phi_u^{j'}(x,j)u^{j'}(x) dx + s\int\int \phi_s^{j'}(x,j)h^{j'}(x,y)dx dy\right]$$


Let $v^j(y)$ be the number of job opportunities posted by a firm $y$  in location $j$.

-   $V^j= \int v^j(y) dy$ is the total number of job opportunities posted  location $j$.

Let $M^j = M(L^j, V^j)$ be the number of job matches in the location $j$ then:

-   The probability that an unemployed worker contacts a vacancy in the location $j$ is $$p^j = \frac{M^j}{L^j}$$
    -   $sp^j$ is the probability that an employed worker contacts a vacancy.
-   The probability that a Ô¨Årm contacts any searching worker $$q^j = \frac{M^j}{V^j}$$
-   Let $\theta^j = V^j / L^j$ be the market tightness in location $j$.

### Dynamic Programming Problem

- $U^{j}(x)$ is the value of being unemployed in location $j$ with type $x$.
- $J^{j}(x,y)$ is the match value in location $j$ with type $x$ and firm $y$.
- $W^{j \to j'}_{0}(x,y)$ is the value of a worker in location $j$ when matched with firm $y$ in location $j'$.
- $W^{j \to j'}_{1}(x,y\to y')$ is the value of a worker in location $j$ when matched with firm $y$ in location $j'$ and then matched with firm $y'$ in location $j'$.

### Worker

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
U^{j}(x) = \underbrace{b(x,j)}_{\text{instant utility}} + &\beta\max_{\phi^j_u(x)}\left\{ \underbrace{-c(\phi^j_u(x))}_{\text{cost of search strategy}} \right.  + \\
& \sum_{j'\in \mathcal{J}} \underbrace{\phi^j_u(x, j')}_{\text{weight by probability of search in} j'}\left[ \overbrace{(1-p^{j'})U^{j'}(x)}^{\text{no offer, stays unemployed now in} j'} \right.  \\
& \left. \left. \hspace{0cm} + p^{j'} \underbrace{\int \max\left\{U^{j'}(x),W^{j\to j'}_{0}(x,y)\right\}\frac{v^{j'}(y)}{V^{j'}}dy}_{\text{if offer, pays cost,moves to } j \text{ and then is matched randomly with some firm}} \right] \right\} 
\end{align*}
```

## Value of a match

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
J^j(x,y) = \underbrace{f(x,y,j)}_{\text{match value added}} &+ \beta\left[  \overbrace{ (1-\lambda^j(x,y)) }^{\text{match is destroyed}}\underbrace{U^{j}(x)}_{\text{worker gets unemployment value}} \right. + \\
  & \underbrace{(\lambda^j(x,y)}_{\text{match survives}} \max_{\phi_s^j(x)}\left\{-c(\phi_s^j(x)) +  \sum_{j'\in\mathcal{J}}\phi^j_s(x,j')\left[ \overbrace{(1-sp^{j'})}^{\text{no new offers}} \underbrace{J^j(x,y)}_{\text{stays with same firm}} \right. \right. +\\
& sp^{j'} \left. \underbrace{\int\max\{J^{j}(x,y),W^{j\to j'}_{1}(x,y',y)\}\frac{v^{j'}(x)}{V^{j'}}dy'}_{\text{worker only accepts new offers if value is greater than current match}}  \right]
\end{align*}
```

## Surplus of a Match
$$S^{j\to j'}(x,y) = J^{j'}(x,y) - \left[U^j(x) + F^{j\to j'}\right]$$

## Bargaining

I use the same bargaining as in [@cahucWageBargainingOntheJob2006] this have the following implications for the value that a worker gets from a match:

- Unemployed worker in location $j$ when matched with firm $y$ in location $j'$ gets: $$W^{j \to j'}_{0}(x,y) = (1 - \mu) U^{j'}(x) + \mu [J^{j'}(x,y) - F^{j' \to j}] = U^{j}(x) + \mu \left(J^{j'}(x,y) - [U^{j}(x) + F^{j' \to j}]\right)$$
- Worker employed in location $j$ by firm $y$ when matched with firm $y'$ in location $j'$ gets: $$W^{j \to j'}_{1}(x,y \to y') = (1 - \mu) J^{j}(x,y) + \mu [J^{j'}(x,y') - F^{j' \to j}] = J^{j}(x,y) + \mu \left(J^{j'}(x,y') - J^{j}(x,y) - F^{j' \to j}\right)$$

Plugging this into the Bellman equations we get:

### Worker
```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
U^{j}(x) &= b(x,j) + \beta\max_{\phi^j_u(x)}\left\{ -c(\phi^j_u(x))    + \sum_{j'\in \mathcal{J}} \phi^j_u(x, j')\left[ (1-p^{j'})U^{j'}(x) \right. \right.  \\
& \left. \left. \hspace{3cm} + p^{j'} \int \max\left\{U^{j'}(x),U^{j}(x) + \mu \left(J^{j'}(x,y) - [U^{j}(x) + F^{j' \to j}]\right)\right\}\frac{v^{j'}(y)}{V^{j'}}dy \right] \right\} \\
&= b(x,j) + \beta\max_{\phi^j_u(x)}\left\{ -c(\phi^j_u(x))  +   \sum_{j'\in \mathcal{J}} \phi^j_u(x, j')\left[ (1-p^{j'})U^{j'}(x) + p^{j'}U^{j'}(x)\right. \right.  \\
& \left. \left. \hspace{3cm} + p^{j'} \mu \int \max\left\{0, J^{j'}(x,y) - [U^{j}(x) + F^{j' \to j}] \right\}\frac{v^{j'}(y)}{V^{j'}}dy \right] \right\} \\
&= b(x,j) + \beta\left[U^j(x)\right] + \beta\left( \sum_{j'\in\mathcal{J}}\phi^{j}_{u}(x,j')\left[p^{j'} \mu \int \max\left\{0, J^{j'}(x,y) - [U^{j}(x) + F^{j' \to j}] \right\}\frac{v^{j'}(y)}{V^{j'}}dy \right]   \right. \\
& \hspace{5cm }\left. - c\left(\phi_{u}^{j}(x)\right)\right)
\end{align*}
```

Recall that the surplus of a match is defined as $$S^{j\to j'}(x,y) = J^{j'}(x,y)-[U^j(x)+F^{j \to j'}]$$
We can rewrite the Bellman equation of the unemployed worker as:

$$U^{j}(x) = b(x,j) + \beta\left[U^j(x)\right] + \beta\left( \sum_{j'\in\mathcal{J}}\phi^{j}_{u}(x,j')\left[p^{j'} \mu \int \max\left\{0, S^{j\to j'}(x,y) \right\}\frac{v^{j'}(y)}{V^{j'}}dy \right] - c\left(\phi_{u}^{j}(x)\right)\right)$$

We can derive the optimal strategy for each worker as:
$$\phi_{u}^{j}(x,j')=\frac{\exp{\left(\left[p^{j'} \mu \int \max\left\{0, S^{j\to j'}(x,y) \right\}\frac{v^{j'}(y)}{V^{j'}}dy \right] / c\right)}}{\sum_{\tilde{j}\in \mathcal{J}}\exp{\left(\left[p^{\tilde{j}} \mu \int \max\left\{0, S^{j\to \tilde{j} }(x,y) \right\}\frac{v^{ \tilde{j} }(y)}{V^{\tilde{j}}}dy \right] / c\right)}}$$

Plug back into the value function to get:

$$U^{j}(x) = b(x,j) + \beta\left[\left[U^j(x)\right]  + c\log\left({\sum_{\tilde{j}\in \mathcal{J}}\exp{\left(\left[p^{j'} \mu \int \max\left\{0, S^{j\to j' }(x,y) \right\}\frac{v^{ j' }(y)}{V^{j'}}dy \right] / c\right)}} + c\log(\mid \mathcal{J} \mid ) \right)\right]$$

### Value of a match

Note tha if the match survives the employed worker chooses their optimal search strategy $\phi_s^j(x)$ search in each of the locations $j'$ with the specified probability $\phi_s^j(x,j')$.

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
\max_{\phi_s^j(x)} &\left\{  \sum_{j'\in\mathcal{J}}\phi^j_s(x,j') \left[ (1-sp^{j'}) J^j(x,y) \right.\right. \\ & \left.\left. + sp^j\int\max\{J^{j}(x,y), J^{j}(x,y) + \mu \left(J^{j'}(x,y') - J^{j}(x,y) - F^{j' \to j}\right)\}\frac{v^{j'}(x)}{V^{j'}}dy' \right] \right\}
\end{align*}
```

Wich can be rewritten as:

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
J^j(x,y) + \max_{\phi_s^j(x)} \left\{  \sum_{j'\in\mathcal{J}}\phi^j_s(x,j') \left[ sp^j\int\max\{0,  \mu \left(J^{j'}(x,y') - J^{j}(x,y) - F^{j' \to j}\right)\}\frac{v^{j'}(x)}{V^{j'}}dy' \right] \right\}
\end{align*}
```

Since 
$$S^{j\to j'}(x,y') = J^{j'}(x,y') - \left[U^j(x) + F^{j \to j'}\right]$$
then 
$$S^{j\to j'}(x,y') - S^{j\to j}(x,y) = J^{j'}(x,y') - J^{j}(x,y) - F^{j' \to j}$$

Then we can rewrite the previous equation as:

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
J^j(x,y) + \max_{\phi_s^j(x)} \left\{  \sum_{j'\in\mathcal{J}}\phi^j_s(x,j') \left[ sp^j\int\max\{0,  S^{j\to j'}(x,y') - S^{j\to j}(x,y) \}\frac{v^{j'}(x)}{V^{j'}}dy' \right] \right\}
\end{align*}
``` 
We can derive the optimal strategy for each worker as:

$$\phi_{u}^{j}(x,y,j')=\frac{\exp{\left(\left[p^{j'} \mu \int \max\left\{0, S^{j\to j'}(x,y') - S^{j \to j}(x,y) \right\}\frac{v^{j'}(y')}{V^{j'}}dy' \right] / c\right)}}{\sum_{\tilde{j}\in \mathcal{J}}\exp{\left(\left[p^{\tilde{j}} \mu \int \max\left\{0, S^{j\to \tilde{j} }(x,y')-S^{j \to j}(x,y) \right\}\frac{v^{ \tilde{j} }(y')}{V^{\tilde{j}}}dy' \right] / c\right)}}$$

Plug back into the value function:
```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
J^j(x,y) = f(x,y,j) & + \beta\left [ \left[  (1-\lambda^j(x,y))U^{j}(x)   +\lambda^j(x,y)J^j(x,y) \right] \right. \\ & \left. +\log\left(\sum_{j'\in \mathcal{J}}\exp{\left(\left[p^{j'} \mu \int \max\left\{0, S^{j\to j' }(x,y')-S^{j \to j}(x,y) \right\}\frac{v^{ j' }(y')}{V^{j'}}dy' \right] / c\right)} \right) \right. \\ & \left.- c \log(\mid\mathcal{J}\mid)\right]
\end{align*}
```

### Surplus Value

Let $s(x,y, j \to j') = f(x,y,j') - b(x,j)$ I satart by writing the expression for the surpluss of staying in the same location:

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
S^{j \to j}(x,y) &= J^j(x, y) - U^{j}(x) \\
& = s(x,y,j \to j) + \beta \lambda^j(x,y)\underbrace{\left[J^j(x,y) - U^j(x)\right]}_{S^{j\to j}(x,y)} + \beta c \left[ \Lambda^j_1(x, y) - \Lambda^j_0(x)\right]\\
& = s(x,y,j \to j) + \beta \max\{0, S^{j\to j}(x,y)\} + \beta c \left[ \Lambda^j_1(x, y) - \Lambda^j_0(x)\right]
\end{align*}
```

The terms $\Lambda_0(x)$ and $\Lambda_1(x,y)$ come from the Bellmans of the worker and the match respectively and are defined as:

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
\Lambda_1(x, y) &= \log \left(\sum_{j'\in \mathcal{J}}\exp{\left(\left[p^{j'} \mu \int \max\left\{0, S^{j\to j' }(x,y')-S^{j \to j}(x,y) \right\}\frac{v^{ j' }(y')}{V^{j'}}dy' \right] / c\right)} \right) \\
\Lambda_0(x) &= \log \left(\sum_{j'\in \mathcal{J}}\exp{\left(\left[p^{j'} \mu \int \max\left\{0, S^{j\to j' }(x,y') \right\}\frac{v^{ j' }(y')}{V^{j'}}dy' \right] / c\right)}\right) \\
\end{align*}
```
Next note that the surplus of moving to a different location is:

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
S^{j \to j'}(x,y) &= J^{j'}(x, y) - \left[U^{j}(x) + F^{j \to j'}\right] \\
& = [J^{j'}(x, y) - U^{j'}(x)] + U^{j'}(x) - \left[U^{j}(x) + F^{j \to j'}\right] \\
& = S^{j'\to j'}(x,y) - [U^{j}(x) - U^{j'}(x) + F^{j \to j'}]
\end{align*}
```

# Aglomeration Effects


This section focus on how the distribution of workers (skils) affect both the productivity of matches $f(x,y,j)$ and the instant utility of unemployed  workers $b(x,j)$.

**Location Productivity**

I borrow from [@davisSpatialKnowledgeEconomy2019] in assuming that the productivity of workers in a location $j$ is a result of idea exchange process within each location.

-   Assume that a type $x$ worker in location $j$ has a $\Omega(x, \overline{X}^j)$ where $\overline{X}^j$ is the value of idea exchange in location $j$. Thus: $$f(x,y,j) = f\left(\Omega(x, \overline{X}^j), y\right)$$

-   Assume that the value of idea exchange in location $j$ is a function of the distribution of skills in location $j$:

    $$ \overline{X}^j = \overline{X}\left(\left\{\ell^j(x)\right\}\right) $$

It's natural to make the following assumptions on $\Omega(x, \overline{X}^j)$ and $\overline{X}^j$:

-   **Assumption 1**: $\Omega(x, \overline{X}^j)$ should be increasing in $x$ and $\overline{X}^j$ and in the absence of idea exchange, worker productivity is just their type: $\Omega(x, 0) = x$.
-   **Assumption 2**: Worker type $x$ and idea exchange environment are complements i.e. $\Omega(x, \overline{X}^j)$ supermodular in ($x$ , $\overline{X}^j$).
-   **Assumption 3**: The value of idea exchange in location $j$ is increasing in the number of potential exchange partners $\mu^j$ and on the distribution of skills in location $j$ $\ell^j(x)$.
    -   With the *FOSD* order of distributions.

I will focus on the following functional forms for $\Omega(x, \overline{X}^j)$ and $\overline{X}^j$:

$$\Omega(x, \overline{X}^j) = x(1 + A \overline{X}^j x)$$
where $A$ is a parameter that captures the scope of gains from idea exchange.

$$
    \overline{X}\left(\left\{\ell^j(x)\right\}\right) = \left(1 - e^{-\nu \int \ell^j(x) dx}\right)\hat{x}^j =\left(1 - e^{-\nu \mu^j} \right)\hat{x}^j
$$

The probability of encountering someone during each moment of time seeking is given by $1 - \exp(-ŒΩ \mu^j)$, note that as the number of potential exchange partners ($\mu^j$) increases, the probability of encountering someone also increases, which makes intuitive sense.

The average ability of the individuals you encounter in these exchanges is denoted as $\hat{x}^j$. This is a weighted average of the abilities of the people you meet $$\hat{x}^j = \frac{1}{\mu^j}\int{x\ell^j(x)dx}=\frac{\mathbb{E}^j[x]}{\mu^j}$$ where $\mathbb{E}^j[x]$ is the average ability of workers in location $j$.

$$
f(x,y,j,z_t) = \Omega(x,\overline{X}^j)^\alpha y^{1-\alpha}
$$ {#eq-prod_funct}

**Cost of living**

-   As in [@davisSpatialKnowledgeEconomy2019] and [@behrensProductiveCitiesSorting2014a] every individual in location $j$ pays the congestion cost :

$$c_j = c(\zeta_j) = \theta\zeta_j^{\gamma}$$


# Computation of Equilibrium

Right now I'm brute forcing the computation of the equilibrium, I'm using the following algorithm:

Take $\ell(x)$ as a primitive. Make initial guesses for $\ell^j(x)$. Initialize $S^{j \to j'}(x,y) \equiv 0$ for all $j$, $j'$, $x$ and $y$.

1. Using $S^{j \to j'}(x,y)$ update the distribution of employed and unemployed workers in each location $j$.

2. Compute the value $B^j(y)$ of vacancy creation.

3. Compute:

    - $v^j(y)$ the number of vacancies posted by a firm $y$ in location $j$.
    - $V^j= \int v^j(y) dy$ the total number of job opportunities posted  location $j$.
    - $L^j$ the total search intensity in location $j$.
    - $\theta^j = V^j / L^j$ the market tightness in location $j$.

4.  Compute $S^{j \to j'}(x,y)$, and $U^{j}$.

    - Obtain wokers optimal strategies $\phi^j_u(x)$ and $\phi^j_s(x)$.

5. Update the distribution of workers in each location $j$.

    - If the distribution of workers in each location $j$ has converged stop, otherwise update worker productivity in each location and cost of living and go back to Step 1.
